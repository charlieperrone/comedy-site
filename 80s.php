                        With stand-up having become a popular and legitimate art form in the 1970s, the
                        1980s became the decade when it exploded. The handful of comedy clubs that
                        opened in the '70s had flourished on both coasts. In the '80s, clubs went
                        national; between 1978 and 1988, over 300 comedy clubs sprung up across the U.S.
                        Stand-up comedy was everywhere.Sitcoms                     The '80s also became
                        the decade that stand-up exploded on television. Sitcoms featuring comedians,
                        such as The Cosby Show and Roseanne, became massive hits. And though comics had
                        always been given the opportunity to perform on late-night talk shows (like
                        Johnny Carson'sTonight Show) and variety shows, new programs appeared on TV in
                        the '80s devoted solely to stand-up comedy. The A&E cable network debuted An
                        Evening at the Improv. HBO, which came to popularity in the '80s, aired regular
                        comedy specials like the HBO Comedy Hour and the Young Comedians Showcase. Even
                        MTV started showcasing stand-up comics with its show Half-hour Comedy Hour,
                        hosted by comedian Mario Joyner.

                        The unbelievable success of stand-up comedy in the 1980s meant only one thing: sooner or later, the bubble had to burst. Though comedy went out on top at the end of the decade, it was only a matter of time before overexposure led to a collapse -- and that's exactly what happened in the early 1990s.

                    <p>While some comedians stuck
                        strickly to joke telling and funny business, many of the most memorable and
                        lasting performers developed identifiable characters and used them as their
                        acts.  For them, the crossover to TV was very easy - after all, they were actors
                        at heart.  While some comedians broke through to television sitcoms in the 70s,
                        the stand-up boom required that some comedians reach out as viable actors begin
                        moving on to bigger and more broadcasted forms of entertainment.  For young
                        comics, TV shows and sitcoms were another viable way                         to
                        get noticed in the funny business.  Shows like Roseanne and The Cosby Show were
                        extremely popular in the 80s.  The Cosby Show was a landmark television show,
                        because it was one of the first times a show was based on a comedian's
                        character, rather than a comedian developing a new character for the show.</p>

Originally started in the UK, Bob Zmuda created a charitable organization called Comic Relief in 1986. The event raised money for homeless in America. Many high profile actors and comedians participated in the event by doing short comic routines. The event was aired each year on HBO.</p>
