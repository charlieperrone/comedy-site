                then ever for entertainers of any kind to be succesful.  The most interesting comics, then, are
                the ones who adapt to new trends and technologies.  Their stand-up routines are culturally relevant
                to things that are happening to us: cellphones and computers, the internet, and digital isolation.

                    The current state of stand-up comedy is alive and well.  Comedians like Aziz Ansari,
                    Kevin Hart and others are still carrying on the tradition of spoken word storytelling.  
                    Other comedians, however, are exploring more varied mediums of comedy.

            <h1>Louis CK and Self-Distribution</h1>

            <div class="col5">

                <p>
                    In 2009, Louis CK produced his own stand-up special titled 'Shameless' which he wrote and directed himself.  He sold the special to Epix and Comedy Central which delayed the release to 2010.  He dused the same approach with his next special 'Live at The Beacon Theater' and sold it on his website for $5.
                </p>

                <h3 class="color-c open-box">This self-produced and self-distrubuted model has proven succesful and has been influential to other comedians like Jim Gaffigan, and Aziz Ansari.</h3>

                <p>
                An already established comedian and filmmaker, Louis has had 3 succesful seasons of
                his hit TV show "Louie".  In the show, he plays himself and takes viewers through the
                troubling and awkward moments of his life.  The episodes feature his signature dark 
                sense of humor and read more as short films than as sitcoms.  In addition, He includes 
                stand-up segments from his current act.  "Louie" is a groundbreaking TV show because 
                it breaks genre stereotypes of what a comedy TV show should be.

            <div class="col5">

                <p>Many comedians have taken to the internet to distribute their acts and keep writing dialogues.  Recently, podcasting has become a more normal venture for comedians.  Many will host comedy talk shows that are essentially radio programs.  In this medium they can do anything from demonstrating new material to inviting guests to sit down and talk comedy.    
                </p>

                <h3 class="color-c open-box">Marc Maron is perhaps the best known in this new podcast trend.</h3>

                <p>His show called "WTF with Marc Maron", is produced and distributed from his garage.  Part of the show is confessional, neurotic comedy monologues.  Maron discusses current issues in his life including addiction, his love-life and social situations.
                </p>

                <p> For the next part, he invites guest of all disciplines onto the show: musicians, comedians, actors, writers.  Such guests have included Nick Cave, Thom Yorke, Jim Gaffigan and Louis CK.
